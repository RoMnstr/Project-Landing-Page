Starting a new assignment from The Odin Project

I have created a new repository for the new assignment. I had made a mistake previously in that I tried to commit messages for the project without making a new repo on my Github profile and had gone ahead with making some headway in the project itself. I will try to fix this and make commits noting any changes I will make moving forwards as I still have a lot of work to do on this project.
